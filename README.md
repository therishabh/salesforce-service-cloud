## Case Object

A case object typically represents a customer issue or problem, and this object is mainly used by your customer support or your support agents who are constantly in touch with the clients trying to solve their issues.</br>

Support agents can review cases to see how they can deliver better service to their clients</br>

So some of the important details or data that we store in Salesforce for the case objects are accounts. Then we have the comments, which is your service agents comments regarding this case.Then we have the open date and close date, which is basically the date on which the case has been opened and the date on which it has been closed. Then we have contact which is lookup to the contact object (support agent can add the contact who has raised this case.). Then we have the case origin and case status, subject and type.</br>
